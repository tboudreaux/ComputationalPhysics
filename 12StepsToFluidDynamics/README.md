<h2>12 Steps to Fluid Dynamics</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Fluid dynamics reside in some of the most complex parameter spaces of any physical problems. Computer are an essential tool to the modern understanding of fluid dynamics due to their ability to make very accurate numerical estimates at small time steps in the future. Computational fluid dynamics (CDF) is the study of fluid dynamics questions through the use of computers. This field is usually "off-limits" to undergradueats; however Lorena A. Barba has provided a set of clear <a href="http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/">Jupyter notebooks</a> which allow students to break into the world of CDF. This notebook will serve as a high level overview of that 12 step course. This notebook will be broken into three sections: one dimension, two dimensions, and cavity flow. These sections loosley match those of the MOOC.

<h3> Dependencies </h3>
To run this notebook you will need Python 3.6 or greater, numpy, sympy, matplotlib, and ipywidgets.
