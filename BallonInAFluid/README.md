<h2>A Simple Model of a ballon in a fluid of Uniform Density</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
Here I present two simple models of a balloon in a confined space. In the first the balloon is acted upon by gravity and a buoyant force. Additionally, there is an effective infintite in magnitude and infintesimal in time normal force applied to the ballon at the boundaries of some user defined volume. The volume containes two fluids, each with a different (but uniform) density. The second model is simialar to the first; however, it may contain much more complex density perturbations throughout, and an additional "wind" force is included in all three spacial dimensions. This model demonstrates how density perturbations may be used as approximations of soft constraint boundaries.
