<h2>Interactive Fourier Serise Demo</h2>

<h1>Indroduction</h1>
The fourier serise is the most obvious, and analytic, manifestation of Fourier's Theorum (Taylor 192). The serise is defined in its purest form as the sumation of an infinite set of sin waves of varying amplitides and angular frequencies. The general form of the serise if given as:
$$
f(t) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0}[a_{n}\cos(n\omega t) + b_{n}\sin(n\omega t)]
$$
We can expand the serise to $n$ terms to fit to any periodic function to an arbitrary level of presicion.
