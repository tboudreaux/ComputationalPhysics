# ComputationalPhysics
A collection of the Six projects I did over the semester in the computational physics course (PHY-2200) at High Point University

# Background
I enrolled computational physics my senior year, the class was project based, these are the projects which I worked over that semseters. 

# Project Descriptions

  * 12StepsToFluidDynamics
    * I work through 12 Steps To Navier Stokes, Giving myself a crash course, by way of overview, in computational fluid dynamics
    * See Lorena A. Barba's set of clear <a href="http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/"> Jupyter notebooks</a>
    
  * BallonInAFluid
    * I build a simple model of a bouyant ballon in a fluid of variable density. I use the variable density to build soft boundary condistions and sucsesfully contain the ballon to a small area with these boundary conditions.
    
  * InteractiveFourierSerise
    * I demonstrate the module ipywidgets for making interactive demonstrations, spesifically how to make a widget which increases the number of terms in a fourier serise approximation of a square wave
    
  * PressurizedBallon
    * I build a model of ball-spring model of a ballon under external pressure, I then sucsessfully pressurize it by running an nbody simulation of particles who interact via the lenard-jones potential.
    
  * SpeedyNBody
    * I build an NBody integrator three differnet ways, showing the speed advantages of each way. Once with python and numby, once with numba, and once with pyCUDA.
    
  * YoungsModulusOfABallSpringSolid
    * I build a ball and damped spring model of a solid a measure youngs modules of that solid for a variety of spring constants and dampening constants.
    
    
If you are someone in the future looking through these I hope they are helpful!

# Thanks
Thanks to Dr. Aaron titus for teaching the computaional physics course, it was very enjoyable and I learned a lot in it! It also happened to be the last physics course class I took as an undergraduate physics major, it was a very good way to end that part of my physics education.
