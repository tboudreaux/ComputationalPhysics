<h1> Measuring Youngs Modulus of a Ball Spring Model Solid </h1>
<h2> Thomas M. Boudreaux </h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Introductory physics course teach a ball spring model of solids, using only this model it is possible to make numerical simulations demonstrationg traditionally more complex propoerties of solids which do not feature heavily in introductory course work. Here I present a simple method to measure youngs modulus of a 2-Dimensional solid modeled as point masses connected in a lattice of damped springs. This could be adapted to an introductory lab allowing students to investigate emergent properties of solids computationally.
